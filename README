I am using the SBUS to connect a FRSKY 8XR to a Beaglebone Black.
This is based off the MBED project:
https://developer.mbed.org/users/Digixx/notebook/futaba-s-bus-controlled-by-mbed/

My library uses the BlackLib library by Yigit Yuce (http://yigityuce.com)

Current status:
	Test UART serial ports on the beaglebone.
